SUMMARY:Sentire
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:Author: 40:Marcello Lussana\nType: Installation\nTopics: Audio 
 and Music Languages\, Interactive Art\, Music Composition\, Projects Reali
 zed using Linux Audio\, Signal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: e
 mbodiement\, interactive\, sound\, installation\, performance\nAbstract: S
 entire is an Italian word that means both to hear and to feel. The project
  is about exploring the fine mixture of these two senses and\, particularl
 y\, to their amplification and morphing.\n\n'Sentire' project was initiate
 d by two Berlin-based artists Marcello Lussana and Olga Kozmanidze in 2016
 . The project consists of two parts: immersive performance series based on
  interactive sound and PhD research on human perception. In the course of 
 the project we have been using a device (bracelets) connecting two people 
 to the sound system and tracking distance and touch events between them. W
 e apply and constantly develop a method of device usage according to which
  participants proceed through a scenario of two phases interaction. Depend
 ing on distance and touch between them different sounds are triggered and 
 changing\, creating an instant sound feedback. Gradually both hearing and 
 sense of touch morth one into another giving a chance to perceive one's bo
 dy on a deep level.\n\nThe interactive system has been designed with the S
 upercollider software and it runs on Linux Mint.\nID: 17

SUMMARY:TXTED - interactive audio-visual performance using open-source musi
 cal machine learning interaction
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: 42:Shawn Trail\nType: Performance\nKeywords: NIME\, Pur
 edata\, Raspberry Pi\nAbstract: This is a proposal to perform a new body o
 f work using a new pitched percussion hyperinstrument system featuring a m
 achine learning tool designed for music performance. All software was desi
 gned in Puredata and runs on a Raspberry Pi with multichannel audio in/out
 . The framework consists of custom idiomatic gesture interfaces and proces
 sing software for an electric lamellophone with embedded gesture sensing. 
 The instrumental framework is accompanied by an interactive video synthesi
 zer built in GEM and also running on a Raspberry Pi\, networked together w
 irelessly. The project represents the culmination of the Phd research rece
 ntly completed by the artist [1][2].\n\n1.Non-invasive sensing and gesture

SUMMARY:COSMO
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: 43:Felix Hofmann\nType: Performance\nKeywords: performa
 nce\, saxophone\, raspberry pi\, csound\nAbstract: COSMO Collective is an 
 open musical collaboration for musicians using DIY electronics and custom 
 software written in Csound. There is no definite musical style\, though it
  could perhaps be characterized as electro-acoustic\nimprovisation. The fo
 cus is on the exploration of sound and timbre\, rather than traditional ha
 rmonics and rhythm\, and exploiting the powers of Csound in this pursuit.\

SUMMARY:Tessellations
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: 44:José Rafael Subía Valdez\nType: Performance\nTopic
 s: Live Performance\, Music Composition\nKeywords: live electronics\, pure
  data\nAbstract: Tessellations plays with the repetition of material gener
 ated by manipulating the interval structure of the chord and submitting it
  to short processes that I generate myself in Python and execute them insi
 de PD with the py object. This piece is an experimentation on the way I li
 nk time\, material and narrative. The “tessellated” object not only mo
 rphs the musical material but also the space where it occurs and the perfo
 rmer responsible for it – player or computer –. Furthermore\, the piec
 e has 2 solos\, one in which the performer improvises based on visual cues
  and musical anchor points\, and the other which was generated algorithmic
 ally and is “written” on the score\, this incorporates the idea of the
  act of composition as the tessellated object itself.\nID: 23

DESCRIPTION:Author: 45:Claude Heiland-Allen\nType: Performance\nTopics: Liv
 e Coding\nKeywords: audio\, live-coding\, performance\, C\nAbstract: Claud
 e Heiland-Allen (https://mathr.co.uk) is an artist from London interested 
 in the complex emergent behaviour of simple systems\, unusual geometries\,
  and mathematical aesthetics.\n\nClive is an audio live-coding skeleton\, 
 implemented in C. It supports a two-phase edit-commit coding cycle allowin
 g long-lived signal processing graphs to be modified without interrupting 
 the sound.\n\nPerformance with Clive usually involves pre-preparation\, fr
 om simple unit generators up to more complete compositions. The live-codin
 g aspect involves editing a file in the performer’s favourite text edito
 r\, with the act of saving with Ctrl-S or other shortcut being timed to al
 low the new code to start executing in sync after the latency of compilati
 on.\nID: 22

 he Electronic\nOrchestra Charlottenburg (EOC)\, a project of the Electroni
 c\nMusic Studio at TU Berlin\, explores means of organizing and\nspatializ
 ing the seemingly infinite diversity of electronic\nsounds in a larger ens
 emble.\n\nThe Metaphysics of Notation (2008)\, by Mark Applebaum\, is a\ng
 raphical score with a length of 22 meters\, divided into 12\npanels.For th
 e interpretation of the score\, each instrument is assigned one or several
  panels. The piece is performed\nwithout a fixed time grid.\nThe performan
 ce will be spatialized using the SSR\, PD and\nPython\, running on a Linux
  Server with Ubuntu Studio. The\nserver is remote controlled by the sound 
 director via OSC and various input devices. Inputs and outputs are managed
  with a RME MADI card and several AD/DA converters.\nID: 47

SUMMARY:Gestural Performance 2
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: 7:Joao Pais\nType: Performance\nKeywords: gestural perf
 ormance\, leapmotion\, pure data\nAbstract: This semi-improvised performan
 ce is the next step of an ongoing research for a gestural performance inst
 rument being developed by Pais. Using the LeapMotion sensor together with 
 custom-made gesture interpretation and synthesis objects in Pure Data\, th
 e expressiveness of the performer's hand movements is reflected in the exp
 ressiveness of the sound that is produced and in its integration in space 
 in a multichannel setup. The aim is to produce a developing event\, where 
 the gestures visible to the audience acquire a new meaning in each new sou
 nd context present in during the performance.\nID: 27
