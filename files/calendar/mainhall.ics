STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: 4:Artem Popov\nType: Paper\nTopics: Signal Processing a
 nd Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: Perlin noise\, simplex noise\, fractional br
 ownian motion\, sound synthesis\nAbstract: Perlin noise is a well known al
 gorithm in computer graphics applications and one of the first algorithms 
 for generating procedural textures. It has been very widely used in movies
 \, games\, demos\, and landscape generators\, but despite its popularity i
 t has been seldom used for creative purposes in the fields outside the wor
 ld of computer graphics. This paper discusses the use of Perlin noise and 
 fractional Brownian motion for sound synthesis applications.\nID: 14

SUMMARY:Rtosc - Realtime Safe Open Sound Control Messaging
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: 16:Mark McCurry\nType: Paper\nTopics: MIDI\, OSC\nKeywo
 rds: Open Sound Control\, Realtime\, Intra-Process Communications\nAbstrac
 t: Audio applications which go beyond MIDI processing often utilize OSC (O
 pen\nSound Control) to communicate complex parameters and advanced operati
 ons.\nA variety of libraries offer solutions to network transportation of 
 OSC\nmessages and provide approaches for pattern matching the messages in 
 dispatch.\nDispatch however is performed inefficiently and manipulating OS
 C messages is\noftentimes not realtime safe.\nrtosc was written to quickly
  dispatch and manipulate large quantities of OSC\nmessages in realtime con
 strained environments.\nThe fast dispatch is possible due to the internal 
 tree representation as well\nas the use of perfect-minimal-hashing within 
 the pattern matching phase of\ndispatch.\n\nThe primary user of rtosc is t
 he ZynAddSubFX project which uses OSC to map\n3\,805\,225 parameters and r
 outinely dispatches bursts of up to 1\,000 messages\nper second during nor
 mal audio processing.\nFor audio application rtosc provides a simple OSC s
 erialization toolset\, the\nrealtime safe dispatch mechanisms\, a ringbuff
 er implementation\, and a rich\nmetadata system for representing applicati
 on/library parameters.\nThis combination is not available in any other OSC
  library at the time of\nwriting.\nID: 39

SUMMARY:SHIFT
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: 25:Andre Bartetzki\nType: Performance\nAbstract: SHIFT 
 (2014)\npsychoacoustic music for 140 oscillators\n\nSHIFT is rather a psyc
 hoacoustic than an electroacoustic piece. Because the usual musical aspect
 s of composition\, temporal structures or single sound events are secondar
 y here. The focal point of this piece is the shifting attention during lis
 tening. The essential events in this piece are the individual moments when
  the attention of the listener detaches itself from the perceived sound wh
 ich evolves only very slowly and which seems to be rather static for a lon
 g time.\nLooking for changes in the environment and being alerted by sudde
 n events is the daily business of our brains - a heritage of our evolution
 ary history. We are adapting our senses to the slightest input changes if 
 nothing else is happening. So even when there is just one and the same sou
 nd texture we tend to extract a foreground from a slowly changing backgrou
 nd after a while - even when there is no real difference.\nThe points of a
  change in the listeners perception\, the detection - or rather invention 
 - of events or objects\, are highly individual here - they are not compose
 d\, they appear only in the heads of the listeners.\nMy advice for listeni
 ng to this piece is: do not try to analyze the sounds as you would do with
  other pieces but try to focus on how you listen to it - be attentive to y
 our attention!\n\nThis piece is generated in realtime with SuperCollider. 
 It is based on additive synthesis techniques:\nthere are 140 single sine o
 scillators which are always modulated in frequency\, amplitude and spatial
  position. The modulation processes for all oscillators are basically the 
 same but the do not happen exactly at the same time\, they are spread over
  long time intervals - resulting in slowly evolving sound textures.\nThe 1
 40 generated audio signals are dynamically distributed in space by the sof
 tware and adapted to as many as available loudspeakers in order to get a r
 eal immersive experience.\nID: 16

CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: 5:Stefan Westerfeld\nType: Paper\nTopics: Audio Plugins
 \, Signal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: Morphing\, timbre\, au
 dio\, spectral modelling\nAbstract: SpectMorph is an open source software 
 which performs morphing of the timbre of musical instruments. This allows 
 creating sounds that smoothly transition from the timbre of one instrument
  to the timbre of another instrument. There are three steps necessary to o
 btain the final sound. In the analysis\, we use the fourier transform to c
 reate models of the spectrum of the input samples. During synthesis a time
  domain signal can be obtained from these data. An algorithm for morphing 
 the spectral models of multiple instruments is the core of our method. Syn
 thesis and morphing can be done in real-time. After the description of the
  theoretical background\, we provide an overview of the features of the Sp
 ectMorph plugin.\nID: 18

  is a technology that synchronizes musical beat\, tempo\, phase\, and star
 t/stop commands across multiple applications running on one or more device
 s. Unlike conventional musical synchronization technologies\, Link does no
 t require master/client roles. Automatic discovery on a local area network
  enables a peer-to-peer system\, which peers can join or leave at any time
  without disrupting others. Musical information is shared equally among pe
 ers\, so any peer can start or stop while staying in time\, or change the 
 tempo\, which is followed by all other peers.\nID: 42

 d the second server type is a digital signal processing server. The Linux 
 real time operating system configurations are discussed\, as well as the s

 rds: Interface Design\, LV2\, VST\, Ruby\nAbstract: Audio tools face a set
  of uncommon user interface\ndesign and implementation challenges. These c
 onstraints make high quality interfaces within the open\nsource realm part
 icular difficult to execute on volunteer time. The challenges include prod
 ucing a\nunique identity for the application\, providing easy\nto use cont
 rols for the parameters of the application\,\nand providing interesting wa
 ys to visualize the data\nwithin the application. Additionally\, existing 
 toolkits produce technical issues when embedding within\nplugin hosts. MRu
 by-Zest is a new toolkit that was\nbuild while the ZynAddSubFX user interf
 ace was\nrewritten. This toolkit possesses unique characteristics within o
 pen source toolkits which target the\nproblems specific to audio applicati
 ons.\nID: 38

SUMMARY:RSVP\, a preset system solution for Pure Data
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: 6:Jose Rafael Subía Valdez\nType: Paper\nTopics: Audio
  and Music Languages\, Interface Design\, Live Performance\, Music Composi
 tion\, Music Production\nKeywords: state-saving\, GUI\, interpolation\, ex
 ternal\, abstraction\nAbstract: This paper describes the logic and process
  behind the development of the RSVP preset library for the Pure Data progr
 amming environment. The library aims to tackle the lack of a native preset
  system in Pure Data. Other projects like Kollabs\, CREAM\, sssad\, and ot
 hers\, have produced different solutions for this issue. However\, after e
 xperimenting with the mentioned libraries\, I decided to approach the matt
 er with a different strategy. This led to the creation of the RSVP library
  which I will be describing in detail. During the development of this proj
 ect\, I have been theorizing of a feature request for PD that will also be
  shared here. This paper will offer a detailed description of how the syst
 em works\, but will not go into extensive Pure Data patch descriptions. In
 stead\, I wish to show how I structured the code and describe how the syst
 em functions with the users own projects.\nID: 32

SUMMARY:Understanding and being creative with Pure Data’s data structures
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: 7:Joao Pais\nType: Workshop\nTopics: Audio and Music La
 nguages\nKeywords: pure data\, data structures\, data visualization\, data
  interaction\nAbstract: Pure Data’s data structures are one of the few c
 ore features that distinguish Pd from Max/MSP. Yet\, they’re also one of
  the few modules which are used solely by a small group of users. The main
  reasons for this would be both the not yet very mature and complete colle
 ction of objects\, as well as not very intuitive implementation in Pd’s 
 language.\nThis workshop illustrates the possibilities of Pd’s data stru
 ctures as a fruitful companion to any Pd user interested in a closer and m
 ore flexible interaction with the graphical representation of data.\nThe f
 irst part explains how to program with data structures (and their shortcom
 ings). The second part analyses several examples of “real life” situat
 ions (display and control examples\, up to complex patches to control / ge
 nerate music in realtime).\nAfter this workshop\, it should be clear how t
 o program with data structures\, and integrate them inindividual patches.\
