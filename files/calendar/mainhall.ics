 https://media.ccc.de/v/lac2018-39-rtosc_realtime_safe_open_sound_control_m
 essaging\nAbstract: Audio applications which go beyond MIDI processing oft
 en utilize OSC (Open\nSound Control) to communicate complex parameters and
  advanced operations.\nA variety of libraries offer solutions to network t
 ransportation of OSC\nmessages and provide approaches for pattern matching
  the messages in dispatch.\nDispatch however is performed inefficiently an
 d manipulating OSC messages is\noftentimes not realtime safe.\nrtosc was w
 ritten to quickly dispatch and manipulate large quantities of OSC\nmessage
 s in realtime constrained environments.\nThe fast dispatch is possible due
  to the internal tree representation as well\nas the use of perfect-minima
 l-hashing within the pattern matching phase of\ndispatch.\n\nThe primary u
 ser of rtosc is the ZynAddSubFX project which uses OSC to map\n3\,805\,225
  parameters and routinely dispatches bursts of up to 1\,000 messages\nper 
 second during normal audio processing.\nFor audio application rtosc provid
 es a simple OSC serialization toolset\, the\nrealtime safe dispatch mechan
 isms\, a ringbuffer implementation\, and a rich\nmetadata system for repre
 senting application/library parameters.\nThis combination is not available
  in any other OSC library at the time of\nwriting.\nID: 39

SUMMARY:SHIFT
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: 25:Andre Bartetzki\nType: Performance\nAbstract: SHIFT 
 (2014)\npsychoacoustic music for 140 oscillators\n\nSHIFT is rather a psyc
 hoacoustic than an electroacoustic piece. Because the usual musical aspect
 s of composition\, temporal structures or single sound events are secondar
 y here. The focal point of this piece is the shifting attention during lis
 tening. The essential events in this piece are the individual moments when
  the attention of the listener detaches itself from the perceived sound wh
 ich evolves only very slowly and which seems to be rather static for a lon
 g time.\nLooking for changes in the environment and being alerted by sudde
 n events is the daily business of our brains - a heritage of our evolution
 ary history. We are adapting our senses to the slightest input changes if 
 nothing else is happening. So even when there is just one and the same sou
 nd texture we tend to extract a foreground from a slowly changing backgrou
 nd after a while - even when there is no real difference.\nThe points of a
  change in the listeners perception\, the detection - or rather invention 
 - of events or objects\, are highly individual here - they are not compose
 d\, they appear only in the heads of the listeners.\nMy advice for listeni
 ng to this piece is: do not try to analyze the sounds as you would do with
  other pieces but try to focus on how you listen to it - be attentive to y
 our attention!\n\nThis piece is generated in realtime with SuperCollider. 
 It is based on additive synthesis techniques:\nthere are 140 single sine o
 scillators which are always modulated in frequency\, amplitude and spatial
  position. The modulation processes for all oscillators are basically the 
 same but the do not happen exactly at the same time\, they are spread over
  long time intervals - resulting in slowly evolving sound textures.\nThe 1
 40 generated audio signals are dynamically distributed in space by the sof
 tware and adapted to as many as available loudspeakers in order to get a r
 eal immersive experience.\nID: 16

 rph_morphing_the_timbre_of_musical_instruments\nAbstract: SpectMorph is an
  open source software which performs morphing of the timbre of musical ins
 truments. This allows creating sounds that smoothly transition from the ti
 mbre of one instrument to the timbre of another instrument. There are thre
 e steps necessary to obtain the final sound. In the analysis\, we use the 
 fourier transform to create models of the spectrum of the input samples. D
 uring synthesis a time domain signal can be obtained from these data. An a
 lgorithm for morphing the spectral models of multiple instruments is the c
 ore of our method. Synthesis and morphing can be done in real-time. After 
 the description of the theoretical background\, we provide an overview of 
 the features of the SpectMorph plugin.\nID: 18

SUMMARY:Ableton Link – A technology to synchronize music software

 \nAbstract: Ableton Link is a technology that synchronizes musical beat\, 
 tempo\, phase\, and start/stop commands across multiple applications runni
 ng on one or more devices. Unlike conventional musical synchronization tec
 hnologies\, Link does not require master/client roles. Automatic discovery
  on a local area network enables a peer-to-peer system\, which peers can j
 oin or leave at any time without disrupting others. Musical information is
  shared equally among peers\, so any peer can start or stop while staying 
 in time\, or change the tempo\, which is followed by all other peers.\nID:

 :\n\n- Getting a minimal Purr Data installation up and running quickly on 
 Linux (compiling from source).\n\n- First-time setup (configuring MIDI and
  audio devices\, setting up Pd-Lua).\n\n- Real-time audio and MIDI process
 ing\, making music with Purr Data.\n\n- Programming new objects (a.k.a. Pd
  externals) the easy way with Pd-Lua (https://github.com/agraef/pd-lua).\n

 ract: This paper presents a design approach for an AVB network segment dep
 loying two different types of AVB server for multiple parallel streams. Th
 e first type is an UDP proxy server and the second server type is a digita
 l signal processing server. The Linux real time operating system configura
 tions are discussed\, as well as the software architecture itself and the 
 integration of the Jack audio server. A proper operation of the JACK serve
 r\, alongside two JACK clients\, in this multiprocessing environment could
  be shown\, although a persisting buffer leak prevents significant jitter 
 and latency measurements. A coarse assessment shows however\, that the ope
 rations are within reasonable bounds.\nID: 43

 et_system_solution_for_pure_data\nAbstract: This paper describes the logic
  and process behind the development of the RSVP preset library for the Pur
 e Data programming environment. The library aims to tackle the lack of a n
 ative preset system in Pure Data. Other projects like Kollabs\, CREAM\, ss
 sad\, and others\, have produced different solutions for this issue. Howev
 er\, after experimenting with the mentioned libraries\, I decided to appro
 ach the matter with a different strategy. This led to the creation of the 
 RSVP library which I will be describing in detail. During the development 
 of this project\, I have been theorizing of a feature request for PD that 
 will also be shared here. This paper will offer a detailed description of 
 how the system works\, but will not go into extensive Pure Data patch desc
 riptions. Instead\, I wish to show how I structured the code and describe 
 how the system functions with the users own projects.\nID: 32

SUMMARY:Understanding and being creative with Pure Data’s data structures

DESCRIPTION:Author: 7:Joao Pais\nType: Workshop\nTopics: Audio and Music La

  interaction\nVideo: https://media.ccc.de/v/lac2018-26-understanding_and_b
 eing_creative_with_pure_data_s_data_structures\nAbstract: Pure Data’s da
 ta structures are one of the few core features that distinguish Pd from Ma
 x/MSP. Yet\, they’re also one of the few modules which are used solely b
 y a small group of users. The main reasons for this would be both the not 
 yet very mature and complete collection of objects\, as well as not very i
 ntuitive implementation in Pd’s language.\nThis workshop illustrates the
  possibilities of Pd’s data structures as a fruitful companion to any Pd
  user interested in a closer and more flexible interaction with the graphi
 cal representation of data.\nThe first part explains how to program with d
 ata structures (and their shortcomings). The second part analyses several 
 examples of “real life” situations (display and control examples\, up 
 to complex patches to control / generate music in realtime).\nAfter this w
 orkshop\, it should be clear how to program with data structures\, and int
 egrate them inindividual patches.\nID: 26
