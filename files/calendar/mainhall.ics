  Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: Perlin noise\, simplex noise\, fractional brow
 nian motion\, sound synthesis\nAbstract: Perlin noise is a well known algo
 rithm in computer graphics applications and one of the first algorithms fo
 r generating procedural textures. It has been very widely used in movies\,
  games\, demos\, and landscape generators\, but despite its popularity it 
 has been seldom used for creative purposes in the fields outside the world

SUMMARY:Rtosc - Realtime Safe Open Sound Control Messaging
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: Mark McCurry\nType: Paper\nTopics: MIDI\, OSC\nKeywords
 : Open Sound Control\, Realtime\, Intra-Process Communications\nAbstract: 
 Audio applications which go beyond MIDI processing often utilize OSC (Open
 \nSound Control) to communicate complex parameters and advanced operations
 .\nA variety of libraries offer solutions to network transportation of OSC
 \nmessages and provide approaches for pattern matching the messages in dis
 patch.\nDispatch however is performed inefficiently and manipulating OSC m
 essages is\noftentimes not realtime safe.\nrtosc was written to quickly di
 spatch and manipulate large quantities of OSC\nmessages in realtime constr
 ained environments.\nThe fast dispatch is possible due to the internal tre
 e representation as well\nas the use of perfect-minimal-hashing within the
  pattern matching phase of\ndispatch.\n\nThe primary user of rtosc is the 
 ZynAddSubFX project which uses OSC to map\n3\,805\,225 parameters and rout
 inely dispatches bursts of up to 1\,000 messages\nper second during normal
  audio processing.\nFor audio application rtosc provides a simple OSC seri
 alization toolset\, the\nrealtime safe dispatch mechanisms\, a ringbuffer 
 implementation\, and a rich\nmetadata system for representing application/
 library parameters.\nThis combination is not available in any other OSC li
 brary at the time of\nwriting.\nID: 39

 n through all the difficult places\, demonstrate how to set things up with
  a random midi controller (i.e.\, not explicitly supported by Mixxx templa
 tes)\, and how to use scripts.\n\nHopefully after this workshop people wil
 l have a good guide on how to start working with Mixxx!\n\nA list of thing
 s discussed:\n\n1. Choosing an XML template for Mixxx UI\n2. Customizing t
 he template for your needs\n3. Setting up preferences\n4. Adding a midi co

SUMMARY:SHIFT
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: Andre Bartetzki\nType: Performance\nAbstract: SHIFT (20
 14)\npsychoacoustic music for 140 oscillators\n\nSHIFT is rather a psychoa
 coustic than an electroacoustic piece. Because the usual musical aspects o
 f composition\, temporal structures or single sound events are secondary h
 ere. The focal point of this piece is the shifting attention during listen
 ing. The essential events in this piece are the individual moments when th
 e attention of the listener detaches itself from the perceived sound which
  evolves only very slowly and which seems to be rather static for a long t
 ime.\nLooking for changes in the environment and being alerted by sudden e
 vents is the daily business of our brains - a heritage of our evolutionary
  history. We are adapting our senses to the slightest input changes if not
 hing else is happening. So even when there is just one and the same sound 
 texture we tend to extract a foreground from a slowly changing background 
 after a while - even when there is no real difference.\nThe points of a ch
 ange in the listeners perception\, the detection - or rather invention - o
 f events or objects\, are highly individual here - they are not composed\,
  they appear only in the heads of the listeners.\nMy advice for listening 
 to this piece is: do not try to analyze the sounds as you would do with ot
 her pieces but try to focus on how you listen to it - be attentive to your
  attention!\n\nThis piece is generated in realtime with SuperCollider. It 
 is based on additive synthesis techniques:\nthere are 140 single sine osci
 llators which are always modulated in frequency\, amplitude and spatial po
 sition. The modulation processes for all oscillators are basically the sam
 e but the do not happen exactly at the same time\, they are spread over lo
 ng time intervals - resulting in slowly evolving sound textures.\nThe 140 
 generated audio signals are dynamically distributed in space by the softwa
 re and adapted to as many as available loudspeakers in order to get a real
  immersive experience.\nID: 16

CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DESCRIPTION:Author: Stefan Westerfeld\nType: Paper\nTopics: Audio Plugins\,
  Signal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: Morphing\, timbre\, audi
 o\, spectral modelling\nAbstract: SpectMorph is an open source software wh
 ich performs morphing of the timbre of musical instruments. This allows cr
 eating sounds that smoothly transition from the timbre of one instrument t
 o the timbre of another instrument. There are three steps necessary to obt
 ain the final sound. In the analysis\, we use the fourier transform to cre
 ate models of the spectrum of the input samples. During synthesis a time d
 omain signal can be obtained from these data. An algorithm for morphing th
 e spectral models of multiple instruments is the core of our method. Synth
 esis and morphing can be done in real-time. After the description of the t
 heoretical background\, we provide an overview of the features of the Spec
 tMorph plugin.\nID: 18

SUMMARY:RSVP\, a preset system solution for Pure Data
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: Jose Rafael Subía Valdez\nType: Paper\nTopics: Audio a
 nd Music Languages\, Interface Design\, Live Performance\, Music Compositi
 on\, Music Production\nKeywords: state-saving\, GUI\, interpolation\, exte
 rnal\, abstraction\nAbstract: This paper describes the logic and process b
 ehind the development of the RSVP preset library for the Pure Data program
 ming environment. The library aims to tackle the lack of a native preset s
 ystem in Pure Data. Other projects like Kollabs\, CREAM\, sssad\, and othe
 rs\, have produced different solutions for this issue. However\, after exp
 erimenting with the mentioned libraries\, I decided to approach the matter
  with a different strategy. This led to the creation of the RSVP library w
 hich I will be describing in detail. During the development of this projec
 t\, I have been theorizing of a feature request for PD that will also be s
 hared here. This paper will offer a detailed description of how the system
  works\, but will not go into extensive Pure Data patch descriptions. Inst
 ead\, I wish to show how I structured the code and describe how the system
  functions with the users own projects.\nID: 32

SUMMARY:Distributed time-centric APIs with CLAPI
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: Paul Weaver & David Honour\nType: Paper\nTopics: Interf
 ace Design\, MIDI\, OSC\, Music Production\, Networked Audio\nKeywords: AP
 I\, Distributed\, Pub/Sub\, Semantics\, Introspection\nAbstract: Distribut
 ed control of applications by multiple simultaneous devices has traditiona
 lly been achieved via protocols such as MIDI or OSC. These simple protocol
 s require additional semantics\, often communicated out of band\, in order
  to construct meaningful APIs.\nWe present the Concert Light-weight API (C
 LAPI) framework: a session-based pub/sub API framework that aims to simpli
 fy the definition and usage of semantic\, time-centric distributed control
 s.\nID: 54

 o systems\nAbstract: This paper introduces a set of real-time audio proces
 sing blocks that can be used as components in Python scripts. Each of them
  is both a Jack client and a Python class. The full power of Python can be
  used to control these modules\, to combine them into systems of arbitrary
  complexity\, and to interface them to anything that can be controlled fro
 m Python. The rationale behind this approach\, some of the the implementat
 ions details\, and possible applications are discussed.\nID: 46

SUMMARY:Understanding and being creative with Pure Data’s data structures
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: Joao Pais\nType: Workshop\nTopics: Audio and Music Lang
 uages\nKeywords: pure data\, data structures\, data visualization\, data i
 nteraction\nAbstract: Pure Data’s data structures are one of the few cor
 e features that distinguish Pd from Max/MSP. Yet\, they’re also one of t
 he few modules which are used solely by a small group of users. The main r
 easons for this would be both the not yet very mature and complete collect
 ion of objects\, as well as not very intuitive implementation in Pd’s la
 nguage.\nThis workshop illustrates the possibilities of Pd’s data struct
 ures as a fruitful companion to any Pd user interested in a closer and mor
 e flexible interaction with the graphical representation of data.\nThe fir
 st part explains how to program with data structures (and their shortcomin
 gs). The second part analyses several examples of “real life” situatio
 ns (display and control examples\, up to complex patches to control / gene
 rate music in realtime).\nAfter this workshop\, it should be clear how to 
 program with data structures\, and integrate them inindividual patches.\nI

 dio Hardware Support\, Drivers\, System and Sound Architecture\, Mobile Au
 dio\nKeywords: Microphone\, Audio Interface\, Mobile Audio\, embedded Linu
 x devices\nAbstract: The overall target is the making of affordable DIY Am
 bisonics field recorders with individual flair.\nOne central part of this 
 aim is the "Affordable Ambisonics Microphones Array" (AAMA).\nThe usage of
  an embedded Linux computer simplified and accelerated the development of 
 individual solutions of Ambisonics Microphones.\nExtensions to the embedde
 d Linux systems as capes or modules are developed to interface and manage 
 the microphone arrays.\nAlso micro-controller usage for intermediate inter
 facing Linux computers is in focus.\nSensors enhancing the usage of these 
 higher order Ambisonics microphone arrays\, combined with corresponding so
 ftware tools enables the construction of your individual Ambisonics microp
 hone array instance.\nID: 31
