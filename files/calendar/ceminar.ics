SUMMARY:Introduction to pmpd
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: 7:Joao Pais\nType: Workshop\nTopics: Audio and Music La
 nguages\, Signal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: pure data\, phy
 sical modelling\, pmpd\, audio+video control\nVideo: https://media.ccc.de/
 v/lac2018-28-introduction_to_pmpd\nAbstract: Physical modelling is a synth
 esis technique where data is generated through emulating physical models\,
  instead of using premade elements such as wave tables or recorded samples
 . Data based on physical models usually has a more “natural” expressiv
 ity\, as it is based on rules similar to the physics of the natural world.
 \nThis workshop introduces pmpd\, a library by Cyrille Henry that implemen
 ts a mass-spring system to build physical models. The data generated by th
 e circuits can be used as control data for audio or video\, or to syntheti
 ze sounds directly.\nThe workshop will use the software Pure Data\; the pa
 rticipants will receive commented didactic materials\, which they will be 
 able to later edit and tweak for their own use. To learn the concepts\, ex
 perience in Pure Data isn’t necessary – although for further individua
 l work it will be required.\nPartitipants should bring their own laptops a
 nd headphones.\nID: 28

 AC2016@c-base.org-Berlin and LAC2017@UJM-St.Etienne\, as an informal manif
 est (but not exclusive) to the Qstuff* software collection. The future of 
 QjackCtl [1] and the JACK-Audio-Connectionm-Kit\, as the main Linux Audio 
 infrastructure\, shall be the main subject. Yours truly Qtractor [7]\, an 
 audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer should be also of concern for discussion.
  All developers and users are kindly invited to discuss\, complain and mor

 ns for Pure Data\, that are primarily designed for teaching electronic mus
 ic. Moreover\, they have a huge creative potential for experienced pd-user
 s or computer musicians in general\, especially when working on linux-base
 d OS. The flexible and open character of the modular toolset allows multip
 le approaches.\nThe levTools are free and open source. They were developed
  by Marten Seedorf in the context of the Berlin based lev–project\, an e
 ducational project focussing on electronic music culture.\nThis workshop i
 ntroduces the levTools.\nID: 11

SUMMARY:Inbuilt Musicality
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: 20:Hermann Voßeler\nType: Workshop\nTopics: Audio and

 und Synthesis\nKeywords: synthesis\, texture\, voicing\, instrument\, musi
 cal context\nVideo: https://media.ccc.de/v/lac2018-12-inbuilt_musicality\n
 Abstract: This Workshop demonstrates the use of the Yoshimi soft synthesis
 er as a platform for building entirely synthetic musical instruments\, bas
 ed on exploring the structure and interplay of defining traits within musi
 cal sound. Starting from characteristic overtones and spectral patterns as
  foundation\, the specific body of the tone can be shaped by fine tuning t
 he transients. Further techniques of transforming the sound are used to bu
 ild a fabric of related sound layers and create a distinct voice\, able to
  operate within the musical context of the composition.\nID: 12

 bstract: Sentire is an Italian word that means both to hear and to feel. T

 articularly\, to their amplification and morphing.\n\n'Sentire' project wa
 s initiated by two Berlin-based artists Marcello Lussana and Olga Kozmanid
 ze in 2016. The project consists of two parts: immersive performance serie
 s based on interactive sound and PhD research on human perception. In the 
 course of the project we have been using a device (bracelets) connecting t
 wo people to the sound system and tracking distance and touch events betwe
 en them. We apply and constantly develop a method of device usage accordin
 g to which participants proceed through a scenario of two phases interacti
 on. Depending on distance and touch between them different sounds are trig
 gered and changing\, creating an instant sound feedback. Gradually both he
 aring and sense of touch morth one into another giving a chance to perceiv
 e one's body on a deep level.\n\nThe interactive system has been designed 
 with the Supercollider software and it runs on Linux Mint.\nID: 17
