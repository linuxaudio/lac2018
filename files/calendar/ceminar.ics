SUMMARY:Introduction to pmpd
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: 7:Joao Pais\nType: Workshop\nTopics: Audio and Music La
 nguages\, Signal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: pure data\, phy
 sical modelling\, pmpd\, audio+video control\nAbstract: Physical modelling
  is a synthesis technique where data is generated through emulating physic
 al models\, instead of using premade elements such as wave tables or recor
 ded samples. Data based on physical models usually has a more “natural
 ” expressivity\, as it is based on rules similar to the physics of the n
 atural world.\nThis workshop introduces pmpd\, a library by Cyrille Henry 
 that implements a mass-spring system to build physical models. The data ge
 nerated by the circuits can be used as control data for audio or video\, o
 r to synthetize sounds directly.\nThe workshop will use the software Pure 
 Data\; the participants will receive commented didactic materials\, which 
 they will be able to later edit and tweak for their own use. To learn the 
 concepts\, experience in Pure Data isn’t necessary – although for furt
 her individual work it will be required.\nPartitipants should bring their 
 own laptops and headphones.\nID: 28

 Topics: Education and E-Learning\, Live Performance\, Music Production\, S
 ignal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: education\, sound synthesi
 s\, pure data\, purr data\, modular\, toolset\nAbstract: The levTools are 
 a set of abstractions for Pure Data\, that are primarily designed for teac
 hing electronic music. Moreover\, they have a huge creative potential for 
 experienced pd-users or computer musicians in general\, especially when wo
 rking on linux-based OS. The flexible and open character of the modular to
 olset allows multiple approaches.\nThe levTools are free and open source. 
 They were developed by Marten Seedorf in the context of the Berlin based l
 ev–project\, an educational project focussing on electronic music cultur
 e.\nThis workshop introduces the levTools.\nID: 11

 fine tuning the transients. Further techniques of transforming the sound a

SUMMARY:Caracoles IV
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: 22:Jaime E Oliver La Rosa\nType: Installation\nKeywords
 : sound installation\, feedback\nAbstract: Caracoles IV is an installation
  that uses interactive feedback systems to sonically explore modified conc
 h shells known as a pututus\, which are andean musical instruments fashion
 ed out of conch shells. These instruments existed far before colonial occu
 pation in the 15th century and work as a kind of cornet or trumpet\, by ad
 ding an embouchure to the shell. However\, this musical instrument is not 
 created by a human alone\, but is also the creation of a large snail which
  once inhabited it\; it is the mollusc’s exoskeleton and home and it is 
 shaped by its existence. When the snail dies\, the spiral-shaped shell is 
 emptied of its organic body and eventually appropriated by the instrument 
 maker to fashion an instrument out of it. In this installation\, a third a
 ppropriation takes place: I place a microphone in the embouchure and a spe
 aker at the end of the spiral canal and connect them through a feedback sy
 stem controlled by a Pure Data (Pd) patch running on a raspberry pi zero\,
  all hidden inside the shell. The system detects resonant feedback frequen
 cies and temporarily cancels them with filters to push the system to find 
 another resonant frequency\, and so on\, generating in this way a sequence
  of resonant frequencies of the shell. This installation is also a play on
  the belief that conch shells are a way to listen to the sea. In fact\, th
 e shell acts as a filter and resonant cavity to our own bodies and spaces\
 , thus\, its resonant frequencies are activated by the presence of people 
 in the installation space. In this way\, each shell is a collaboration bet
 ween humans\, conch-shells and interactive systems\, but also an interacti
 on between all of the shells because each of them have their own acoustic 
 properties\, but their resonances are audible to each other\, thus generat
 ing unpredictable sonic landscapes.\nID: 57
