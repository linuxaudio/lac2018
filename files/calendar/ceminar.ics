SUMMARY:Introduction to pmpd
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: 7:Joao Pais\nType: Workshop\nTopics: Audio and Music La
 nguages\, Signal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: pure data\, phy
 sical modelling\, pmpd\, audio+video control\nAbstract: Physical modelling
  is a synthesis technique where data is generated through emulating physic
 al models\, instead of using premade elements such as wave tables or recor
 ded samples. Data based on physical models usually has a more “natural
 ” expressivity\, as it is based on rules similar to the physics of the n
 atural world.\nThis workshop introduces pmpd\, a library by Cyrille Henry 
 that implements a mass-spring system to build physical models. The data ge
 nerated by the circuits can be used as control data for audio or video\, o
 r to synthetize sounds directly.\nThe workshop will use the software Pure 
 Data\; the participants will receive commented didactic materials\, which 
 they will be able to later edit and tweak for their own use. To learn the 
 concepts\, experience in Pure Data isn’t necessary – although for furt
 her individual work it will be required.\nPartitipants should bring their 
 own laptops and headphones.\nID: 28

 dio infrastructure\, shall be the main subject. Yours truly Qtractor [7]\,
  an audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer should be also of concern for discuss

 Topics: Education and E-Learning\, Live Performance\, Music Production\, S
 ignal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: education\, sound synthesi
 s\, pure data\, purr data\, modular\, toolset\nAbstract: The levTools are 
 a set of abstractions for Pure Data\, that are primarily designed for teac
 hing electronic music. Moreover\, they have a huge creative potential for 
 experienced pd-users or computer musicians in general\, especially when wo
 rking on linux-based OS. The flexible and open character of the modular to
 olset allows multiple approaches.\nThe levTools are free and open source. 
 They were developed by Marten Seedorf in the context of the Berlin based l
 ev–project\, an educational project focussing on electronic music cultur
 e.\nThis workshop introduces the levTools.\nID: 11

 Music Languages\, Media Art\, Music Composition\, Signal Processing and So
 und Synthesis\nKeywords: synthesis\, texture\, voicing\, instrument\, musi
 cal context\nAbstract: This Workshop demonstrates the use of the Yoshimi s
 oft synthesiser as a platform for building entirely synthetic musical inst
 ruments\, based on exploring the structure and interplay of defining trait
 s within musical sound. Starting from characteristic overtones and spectra
 l patterns as foundation\, the specific body of the tone can be shaped by 
 fine tuning the transients. Further techniques of transforming the sound a
 re used to build a fabric of related sound layers and create a distinct vo
 ice\, able to operate within the musical context of the composition.\nID:

SUMMARY:Sentire
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:Author: 40:Marcello Lussana\, Olga Kozmanidze\, Pascal Staudt\n
 Type: Installation\nTopics: Audio and Music Languages\, Interactive Art\, 
 Music Composition\, Projects Realized using Linux Audio\, Signal Processin
 g and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: embodiement\, interactive\, sound\, insta
 llation\, performance\nAbstract: Sentire is an Italian word that means bot
 h to hear and to feel. The project is about exploring the fine mixture of 
 these two senses and\, particularly\, to their amplification and morphing.
 \n\n'Sentire' project was initiated by two Berlin-based artists Marcello L
 ussana and Olga Kozmanidze in 2016. The project consists of two parts: imm
 ersive performance series based on interactive sound and PhD research on h
 uman perception. In the course of the project we have been using a device 
 (bracelets) connecting two people to the sound system and tracking distanc
 e and touch events between them. We apply and constantly develop a method 
 of device usage according to which participants proceed through a scenario
  of two phases interaction. Depending on distance and touch between them d
 ifferent sounds are triggered and changing\, creating an instant sound fee
 dback. Gradually both hearing and sense of touch morth one into another gi
 ving a chance to perceive one's body on a deep level.\n\nThe interactive s
 ystem has been designed with the Supercollider software and it runs on Lin
 ux Mint.\nID: 17
