SUMMARY:Introduction to pmpd
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: Joao Pais\nType: Workshop\nTopics: Audio and Music Lang
 uages\, Signal Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: pure data\, physi
 cal modelling\, pmpd\, audio+video control\nAbstract: Physical modelling i
 s a synthesis technique where data is generated through emulating physical
  models\, instead of using premade elements such as wave tables or recorde
 d samples. Data based on physical models usually has a more “natural” 
 expressivity\, as it is based on rules similar to the physics of the natur
 al world.\nThis workshop introduces pmpd\, a library by Cyrille Henry that
  implements a mass-spring system to build physical models. The data genera
 ted by the circuits can be used as control data for audio or video\, or to
  synthetize sounds directly.\nThe workshop will use the software Pure Data
 \; the participants will receive commented didactic materials\, which they
  will be able to later edit and tweak for their own use. To learn the conc
 epts\, experience in Pure Data isn’t necessary – although for further 
 individual work it will be required.\nPartitipants should bring their own 
 laptops and headphones.\nID: 28

SUMMARY:The levTools – a modular toolset in purr data for creating and te
 aching electronic music
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED

DESCRIPTION:Author: Marten Seedorf & Simon Steinhaus\nType: Workshop\nTopic
 s: Education and E-Learning\, Live Performance\, Music Production\, Signal
  Processing and Sound Synthesis\nKeywords: education\, sound synthesis\, p
 ure data\, purr data\, modular\, toolset\nAbstract: The levTools are a set
  of abstractions for Pure Data\, that are primarily designed for teaching 
 electronic music. Moreover\, they have a huge creative potential for exper
 ienced pd-users or computer musicians in general\, especially when working
  on linux-based OS. The flexible and open character of the modular toolset
  allows multiple approaches.\nThe levTools are free and open source. They 
 were developed by Marten Seedorf in the context of the Berlin based lev–
 project\, an educational project focussing on electronic music culture.\nT
 his workshop introduces the levTools.\nID: 11

  Synthesis\nKeywords: synthesis\, texture\, voicing\, instrument\, musical
  context\nAbstract: This Workshop demonstrates the use of the Yoshimi soft
  synthesiser as a platform for building entirely synthetic musical instrum
 ents\, based on exploring the structure and interplay of defining traits w
 ithin musical sound. Starting from characteristic overtones and spectral p
 atterns as foundation\, the specific body of the tone can be shaped by fin
 e tuning the transients. Further techniques of transforming the sound are 
 used to build a fabric of related sound layers and create a distinct voice
 \, able to operate within the musical context of the composition.\nID: 12

SUMMARY:Caracoles IV
CLASS:PUBLIC
STATUS:CONFIRMED
LOCATION:c-base\, Rungestraße 20\, 10179 Berlin
DESCRIPTION:Author: Jaime E Oliver La Rosa\nType: Installation\nKeywords: s
 ound installation\, feedback\nAbstract: Caracoles IV is an installation th
 at uses interactive feedback systems to sonically explore modified conch s
 hells known as a pututus\, which are andean musical instruments fashioned 
 out of conch shells. These instruments existed far before colonial occupat
 ion in the 15th century and work as a kind of cornet or trumpet\, by addin
 g an embouchure to the shell. However\, this musical instrument is not cre
 ated by a human alone\, but is also the creation of a large snail which on
 ce inhabited it\; it is the mollusc’s exoskeleton and home and it is sha
 ped by its existence. When the snail dies\, the spiral-shaped shell is emp
 tied of its organic body and eventually appropriated by the instrument mak
 er to fashion an instrument out of it. In this installation\, a third appr
 opriation takes place: I place a microphone in the embouchure and a speake
 r at the end of the spiral canal and connect them through a feedback syste
 m controlled by a Pure Data (Pd) patch running on a raspberry pi zero\, al
 l hidden inside the shell. The system detects resonant feedback frequencie
 s and temporarily cancels them with filters to push the system to find ano
 ther resonant frequency\, and so on\, generating in this way a sequence of
  resonant frequencies of the shell. This installation is also a play on th
 e belief that conch shells are a way to listen to the sea. In fact\, the s
 hell acts as a filter and resonant cavity to our own bodies and spaces\, t
 hus\, its resonant frequencies are activated by the presence of people in 
 the installation space. In this way\, each shell is a collaboration betwee
 n humans\, conch-shells and interactive systems\, but also an interaction 
 between all of the shells because each of them have their own acoustic pro
 perties\, but their resonances are audible to each other\, thus generating
  unpredictable sonic landscapes.\nID: 57
