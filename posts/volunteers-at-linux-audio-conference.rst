| Dear Linux Audio Conference friends!
|
| We need your support for this year's conference. Currently we are still
  looking for more volunteers to help us with the following:

* Session Chairs - https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/LAC18_Session/
* Stage Hands - https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/LAC18_Stage/
* Camera/ Videomixer operators - https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/LAC18_Video/

| If you would like to support us, please provide your mail address and
  availability to the corresponding dudle instance.

.. note::

  Your e-mail address will only be used by us to communicate with you through a
  dedicated mailing list, that will be disposed of after the conference.

| A short introduction/workshop for the different kinds of tasks will be held
  on Thursday, **2018-06-07** **16:00 (CEST)** (two hours before the `Welcome
  Speech </pages/event/100/>`_).
|
| We would be very thankful, if you could spent some time with us to help with
  running the conference.
|
| Thanks in advance!
