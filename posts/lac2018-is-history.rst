| The Linux Audio Conference 2018 is history!
|
| We are very grateful for all the submissions, contributions and volunteers,
  that once again made this year an amazing event!
|
| Not all videos are cut yet, but a good first batch is available through
  |media.ccc.de| already. The rest of them will follow shortly. All
  presentations and performances, that were streamed will get their video links
  connected on their respective event pages.
|
| Rui Nuno Capela has once again made available his |rui_pictures| from the
  conference on his website.
| To our sad realization, we have to admit, that the group photo on Saturday
  did not work out. So if you have memorabilia, that you would like to share,
  send us your links and we will publish them here!

.. note::
  If you had a presentation or performance in the course of the conference,
  please make sure to send in any additional material, that you would like to
  make available through the conference website!
