| We are very grateful for the opportunity to use |native_instruments|'
  |native_space| for our *Linux Sound Night* on Saturday (Day 3).
| The company's social space is used by employees and sometimes external
  meetups alike. It's located not far from |c-base|, at *Schlesische Straße 30,
  10997 Berlin*.

.. note::

  As the space is located in the backyard of an office area, we are required to
  take care of a gate to that area (right at *Schlesische Straße 30*). This
  means, that visitors of the *Linux Sound Night* will be let in and out of the
  area on a ten minute schedule only. Please make sure to be on time for the
  concerts!
