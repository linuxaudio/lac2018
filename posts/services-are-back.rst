| As you might have noticed, on January 29th the linuxaudio.org server (hosting
  many more websites and the affiliated mailing lists) was compromised. You can
  read the |full_recap| by Jeremy Jongepier, if you're interested.

| After moving all services to a new location and getting things from backups,
  everything should be operational by now! However, if you see any glitches
  with the openconf submission system, please |contact_us|!
