To get around Berlin with public transport, please have a look at the
`BVG website <http://bvg.de>`__. They offer apps and plans.

An extensive and well-functioning alternative is the `Öffi-App for
Android <http://oeffi.schildbach.de/>`__, using the
`BVG <http://bvg.de>`__ API.

Getting there
-------------

Many ways lead to Rome, plenty more to `c-base <http://c-base.org>`__!

Plane
~~~~~

Berlin has two airports (and maybe... just **maybe** the most expensive
new one ever built, but not yet opened! ;-) ).

-  `Tegel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tegel_Airport>`__
-  `Schönefeld <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Sch%C3%B6nefeld_Airport>`__

Both are well-connected to Berlin-Mitte by public transport during all
hours of the day!

Train
~~~~~

You can come by train to the following train stations:

-  `Hauptbahnhof <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Hauptbahnhof>`__
   (main station), further taking **S5** (-> **Strausberg Nord**),
   **S7** (-> **Ahrensfelde**), **S75** (-> **Wartenberg**) to `S+U
   Jannowitzbrücke <http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/29494301#map=18/52.51536/13.41817&layers=N>`__
-  `Ostbahnhof <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Ostbahnhof>`__
   (east station), further taking **S5** (-> **Spandau**), **S7** (->
   **Potsdam Hbf**), **S75** (-> **Spandau**) to `S+U
   Jannowitzbrücke <http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/29494301#map=18/52.51536/13.41817&layers=N>`__

Tickets
^^^^^^^

`Deutsche Bahn <http://www.bahn.de>`__ is selling train tickets from all
major German cities to Berlin.

Cheap tickets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are ticket reseller companies like
`l'tur <http://www.ltur.com/de/bahn.html>`__, where you can get cheap
tickets in a certain time frame (usually starting from roughly a week
before the travel date).

Staying around
--------------

Although sleep is not allowed at `c-base <http://c-base.org>`__ (no
joke!), you could however stay there overnight, if you're (with) a
member and a cey member is keeping the space station open. The
no-sleep-option is not something one might want to pursue for a couple
of days though.

The below list is just an excerpt of what is available in the close
surrounding. Please, extend as you see fit! Any hostel, hotel, etc.
close to the S/U-Bahn lines (**U2**, **U8**, **S5**, **S7**, **S75**) of
the above mentioned close public transport stops will do, too!

Hotels
~~~~~~

Many hotels are located in Berlin-Mitte. You won't have trouble finding
a room most likely, depending on if you're willing to pay for it.

-  `ibis <http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-3108-ibis-berlin-ostbahnhof/index.shtml>`__,
   near Ostbahnhof
-  `Catalonia <http://www.cataloniaberlinmitte.com/>`__, near U
