**Abstract**: 
The overall target is the making of affordable DIY Ambisonics field recorders with individual flair.
One central part of this aim is the "Affordable Ambisonics Microphones Array" (AAMA).
The usage of an embedded Linux computer simplified and accelerated the development of individual solutions of Ambisonics Microphones.
Extensions to the embedded Linux systems as capes or modules are developed to interface and manage the microphone arrays.
Also micro-controller usage for intermediate interfacing Linux computers is in focus.
Sensors enhancing the usage of these higher order Ambisonics microphone arrays, combined with corresponding software tools enables the construction of your individual Ambisonics microphone array instance.
