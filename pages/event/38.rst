**Abstract**: 
Audio tools face a set of uncommon user interface
design and implementation challenges. These constraints make high quality interfaces within the open
source realm particular difficult to execute on volunteer time. The challenges include producing a
unique identity for the application, providing easy
to use controls for the parameters of the application,
and providing interesting ways to visualize the data
within the application. Additionally, existing toolkits produce technical issues when embedding within
plugin hosts. MRuby-Zest is a new toolkit that was
build while the ZynAddSubFX user interface was
rewritten. This toolkit possesses unique characteristics within open source toolkits which target the
problems specific to audio applications.
