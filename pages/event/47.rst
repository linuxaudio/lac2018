**Abstract**: 
12 electronic and electroacoustic instruments, live
spatialized on a 12-speaker system - the Electronic
Orchestra Charlottenburg (EOC), a project of the Electronic
Music Studio at TU Berlin, explores means of organizing and
spatializing the seemingly infinite diversity of electronic
sounds in a larger ensemble.

The Metaphysics of Notation (2008), by Mark Applebaum, is a
graphical score with a length of 22 meters, divided into 12
panels.For the interpretation of the score, each instrument is assigned one or several panels. The piece is performed
without a fixed time grid.
The performance will be spatialized using the SSR, PD and
Python, running on a Linux Server with Ubuntu Studio. The
server is remote controlled by the sound director via OSC and various input devices. Inputs and outputs are managed with a RME MADI card and several AD/DA converters.
