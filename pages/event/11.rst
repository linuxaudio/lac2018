**Abstract**: 
The levTools are a set of abstractions for Pure Data, that are primarily designed for teaching electronic music. Moreover, they have a huge creative potential for experienced pd-users or computer musicians in general, especially when working on linux-based OS. The flexible and open character of the modular toolset allows multiple approaches.
The levTools are free and open source. They were developed by Marten Seedorf in the context of the Berlin based lev–project, an educational project focussing on electronic music culture.
This workshop introduces the levTools.
