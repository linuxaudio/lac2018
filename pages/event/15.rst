**Abstract**: 
This hands-on workshop is intended for Pd and Linux audio users who want to start using Purr Data. For an introduction to Purr Data, please check our LAC17 presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1wo496Zx0s) and the Quick Introduction (https://agraef.github.io/purr-data-intro). Topics of the 90 min workshop vary from the basics to the moderately advanced and include:

- Getting a minimal Purr Data installation up and running quickly on Linux (compiling from source).

- First-time setup (configuring MIDI and audio devices, setting up Pd-Lua).

- Real-time audio and MIDI processing, making music with Purr Data.

- Programming new objects (a.k.a. Pd externals) the easy way with Pd-Lua (https://github.com/agraef/pd-lua).

- Custom graphics and data structure visualizations in Purr Data.
