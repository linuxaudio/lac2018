**Abstract**: 
The MOD Project: an overview of the history, some comments and
considerations about an Open Source Linux Audio centric hardware business
attempt and some insights for the future.

MOD was born in 2010, first debuted at LAC in 2013, crowdfunded a mass
product in 2014, delivered it in 2016, consolidated in 2017 and got funded
in 2018.

These 8 years have been quite interesting and a lot has happened along. I
would like to go over this history and present what were the main
difficulties found along the way. I’d also put on the table some
considerations about the Open Source Linux Audio centric aspect and its
pros/cons. Finally, I’d like to share some insights and considerations for
the future, both for our company as for the Linux Audio Community and the
possible efforts towards attaining a sustainable business model with the
community efforts.
